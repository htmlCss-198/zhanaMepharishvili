            <p>The architectural concept was inspired by the public square landscape and through the composition, plasticity and texture of trees - large-scale perennial plantations that already existed on project territory.The very landscape and plantations have reasoned creation of composition with three different shade and height buildings in similar to groups of trees.The concept is also supported by variety of gardens, greenhouses and plantations on each floor of the building.The leitmotif of the building exterior also waves into the interior, where vertical wooden elements and natural textures are prevailed in design.On each floor, in elevator passageways or corridors the exterior concept is the constant companion which harmoniously merges with interior through the large stained-glass windows.Paintings by Irakli Gamrekeli will adorn the walls of common areas. These artworks will find their home here as part of Domus collaboration with artists.Davitiani, a multifunctional working and entertainment space in the building, will host various events: musical evenings, exhibitions, seminars, etc.Residents can use the co-working space on a daily basis. Inspiration for the name of this space came from the monument to David Guramishvili, located in front of the building.</p>
